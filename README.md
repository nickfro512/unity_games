VR HORSE README
If you have a VR headset plugged in that works with Unity, it will automatically launch the game in VR mode. Otherwise it will launch as 2D. 

Controls are:

W/A/S/D keys: change direction of boost forward/back/left/right

Mouse x/y: control camera

Left mouse button: shoot

Right mouse button: boost 

*You need to boost off the ground before you can move with WASD.*
