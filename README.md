# unity_games

Some Unity projects I worked on.  gterrainhorse is the source for VR Horse, an incomplete VR arcade game about horses. spaceshootertutes is an implementation of a Unity tutorial.

vrhorse_VR.zip contains the last build of vrhorse. If you have a VR headset plugged in that works with Unity, it will automatically launch the game in VR mode. Otherwise it will launch as 2D. 

Controls are: 
W/A/S/D keys: change direction of boost forward/back/left/right
Mouse x/y: control camera
Left mouse button: shoot
Right mouse button: boost 
*You need to boost off the ground before you can move with WASD.*
